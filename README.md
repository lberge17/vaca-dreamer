# VacaDreamer

- VacaDreamer is an app using a JS frontend and a Ruby on Rails API backend. This project is the fourth project for the Flatiron School. This project is intended mostly to be educational in terms of building.

- The application itself is a dream vacation planner. The API stores anyone's dream vacation and then the frontend displays these for users to get inspiration. The frontend also uses POST and DELETE fetch requests to add or remove vacations to the API.
